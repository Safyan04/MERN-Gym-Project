    Here are some key points for a diet focused on supporting leg exercises:
  </h3>
  <p>
  <b>  1. Protein-rich foods:  </b> <br />
    - Lean meats like chicken, turkey, and lean beef provide essential amino acids for muscle repair and growth. <br />
    - Plant-based proteins such as beans, lentils, tofu, and edamame are great alternatives for vegetarians and
    vegans. <br /> <br />
  <b>  2. Complex carbohydrates:  </b> <br />
    - Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole wheat bread provide sustained energy for workouts. <br />
    - Sweet potatoes and legumes are also good carbohydrate sources. <br /> <br />
  <b>  3. Healthy fats: </b> <br />
    - Incorporate sources like avocados, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia, flaxseed), and olive oil for overall
    health and joint lubrication. <br /> <br />
  <b>  4. Fruits and vegetables:  </b>  <br />
    - Berries, bananas, oranges, and apples offer vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants for recovery and overall
    health. <br />
    - Leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers provide fiber and essential nutrients. <br /> <br />
   <b> 5. Hydration:  </b>  <br />
    - Drink plenty of water throughout the day, and consider incorporating electrolyte-rich beverages like coconut
    water during intense workouts. <br />
   <b> 6. Supplements (optional):  </b>  <br />
    - Whey or plant-based protein powders can supplement protein intake, especially after workouts. <br />
    - Creatine monohydrate may benefit strength and power during resistance training. <br />
   <b> 7. Pre- and post-workout nutrition:  </b> <br />
    - Consume a balanced meal or snack with carbohydrates and protein about 1-2 hours before exercise. <br />
    - After workouts, aim to consume a meal or protein shake within 30 minutes to an hour to support muscle
    recovery. <br /> <br />
   <b> 8. Avoid excess sugar and processed foods:  </b> <br />
    - Minimize intake of sugary drinks, candies, and heavily processed snacks that offer little nutritional value
    and may lead to energy crashes. <br /> <br />
   <b> 9. Monitor portion sizes:  </b> <br />
    - Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating, especially with calorie-dense foods like nuts, seeds, and
    oils.  <br /> <br />
   <b> 10. Consult a nutritionist or dietitian:   </b> <br />
    - Individual nutritional needs vary, so working with a professional can help tailor a diet plan specific to your
    goals and health requirements. <br />

    <br />
    <b>    5. Hydration: </b>  <br />

    <br />
    <b>        6. Pre-Workout Nutrition:</b>  <br />
    - Consume a balanced meal 1-2 hours before your workout, including carbs, protein, and healthy fats. <br />
    <br />
    <b>      7. Post-Workout Nutrition: </b>  <br />
    - Have a protein-rich snack or meal within 30 minutes to an hour after your workout to support muscle repair and
    growth. This could be a protein shake, chicken breast with veggies, or Greek yogurt with fruit.
    <br /> <br />
    <b>  8. Supplements:</b>  <br />  
    - If needed, consider supplements like whey protein, creatine, or branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) under the
    guidance of a healthcare professional or nutritionist. <br />
    <br />
    <b>        9. Avoid Excess Sugar and Processed Foods: </b> <br />
    - Minimize intake of sugary drinks, candies, and processed snacks, as they can lead to inflammation and hinder
    muscle recovery. <br />
    <br />
    <b>   10. Balanced Diet: </b>
    - Focus on a balanced diet that includes lean proteins, healthy fats, complex carbs, vitamins, and minerals to
    support overall health and fitness goals. <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     These dietary guidelines can help fuel your workouts, promote muscle growth, and aid in recovery, which are
    essential for building strong biceps and achieving your fitness goals.
